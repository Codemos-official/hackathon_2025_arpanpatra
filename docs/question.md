Test 1: The Definition (Direct)
Query: "How does Troward define the two parts of the mind?"

Target Answer (What should highlight): "One that thinks in reasons like solving a math problem, and one that just knows things without having to figure them out, that's your intuition."

Why: Tests if it can distinguish between the "reasoning" mind and the "intuitive" mind.

Test 2: The Metaphor (Abstract)
Query: "Does intuition require proof?"

Target Answer: "It's not guessing, it's knowing without proof. You don't have to explain why you feel it."

Why: The word "require" isn't in the text, but "knowing without" is the semantic equivalent.

Test 3: The Example (Contextual - The one you missed)
Query: "Give me a real life example of intuition."

Target Answer: "It's like when you just know your best friend is sad, even if they say they're okay."

Why: This is the ultimate test. The text doesn't say "real life example," it just gives one. The AI must understand that the "friend story" is an example.

Test 4: The Source (Attribution)
Query: "Where does the author say intuition comes from?"

Target Answer: "Troward says, 'Real intuition, it comes from calm, clear, quiet inside.'... Troward believes we are all connected to a bigger, smarter life power."

Why: Tests if it can link the concept of "source/origin" to the phrases "comes from" or "connected to".

Test 5: The Skill (Actionable)
Query: "How can I improve my intuition?"

Target Answer: "You get better at using intuition by listening to it. Just like getting better at playing piano by practicing... learn to trust it."

Why: The query uses "improve," but the text uses "get better." A keyword search would fail here; semantic search should succeed.
